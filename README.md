# Custom-ROM-and-GSI-Flasher

These are only for Windows devices. However, the commands used can also be done on macOS and Linux, when provided with the Android SDK Tools.
A custom ROM and GSI flasher created for Android devices.

Use at your own risk. 

Take note:

Your warranty is now voided; I do not assume responsibility for any actions caused by the end user nor by the device when executing my scripts. Actions that are undergone by you are you and yours only. Do not blame others for your own mistakes, as there are many variables that can be taken into consideration.

##Instructions
The custom ROM flasher is for ROMs that include ADB sideloading, not with TWRP (albeit one can use a recovery that enables ADB sideloading to potentially use this script). 

The GSI flasher is for generic devices - meaning that there are no special features pertaining to any certain brand -; again, do this at your own risk.

Put the two files within your ADB and Fastboot files, and then execute them.

######Have fun!
